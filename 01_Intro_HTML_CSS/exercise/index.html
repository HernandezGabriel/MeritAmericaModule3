        <h2>Cool Facts</h2>
        <blockquote cite="https://blog.remitly.com/finance/costa-rican-colon/">
            The country is known for its national parks, where you can enjoy activities like canyoning, canoeing, and river rafting or see macaws, sea turtles, and sloths. It’s no wonder that wildlife has made its way onto the banknotes, too.
            Since 2012, Costa Rican bills boast a new colorful design inspired by Costa Rica’s animals. The bills sport new patterns with the sloth, the hummingbird, the morpho butterfly, and the white-headed capuchin monkey.       </blockquote>

            The beautiful country, filled with rainforests, beaches, river valleys, and biodiverse wildlife as well as restaurants, bars, and luxe hotels, has always been a great place to take a vacation, but it has gained popularity as an amazing destination in the last few years.

            There are currently six active and over 60 dormant or extinct volcanoes in this relatively small, Central American country. Arenal Volcano is one of Costa Rica’s most popular attractions, especially for people want to hike its rugged terrain or take a dip in the soothing geothermal hot springs. There are lots of spas and resorts in the area that take advantage of the natural hot waters.
